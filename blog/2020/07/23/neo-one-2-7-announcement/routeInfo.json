For this release we have been focused on cleaning up bugs, adding new compiler features, expanding documentation, and preparing for future versions of NEO•ONE as we draw closer to the Neo3 release.\n\nTo get started with NEO•ONE you can install our CLI with\n`yarn add @neo-one/cli`\n\n## Compile\n\nStarting with NEO•ONE 2.7 you will be able to output your compiled smart contract to various format types as well as generate debug information as per the spec listed [here](https://github.com/ngdseattle/design-notes/blob/master/NDX-DN11%20-%20NEO%20Debug%20Info%20Specification.md). We hope this will give our users more freedom in the end-to-end tooling they choose to use for developing their smart contracts. To get started with testing these new features you can use:\n\n`yarn add @neo-one/cli`\\\n`yarn neo-one init`\\\n`yarn neo-one compile --json --avm --debug --opcodes`\n\nFor more information on how to enable AVM / debug generation use\n\n`yarn neo-one compile --help`\n\nor see the [pull request](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one/pull/2071).\n\n### Further Work\n\nWhile we have added the ability to output our compiled smart contracts as `.debug` and `.avm` files there is still work to be done to integrate these features with other tooling, like the Neo Blockchain Toolkit. See the PR linked above or visit the new issue page [here](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one/issues/2113) for more information. Also be sure to check out our [documentation](/docs/how-to-contribute#How-Can-I-Contribute) on building from source if you would like to help contribute to the project!\n\n## Typescript Updates\n\nIn continuing with our efforts to keep NEO•ONE up to date with Typescript we have [updated](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one/pull/2063) the project to use TypeScript version 3.9.5. While there aren’t as many new features available in the compiler as our [last](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one/pull/1984) update we want to keep our feature set as familiar to new developers as we can, especially as we gear up for Neo3.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe’ve added several new sections of documentation to the website:\n\n- [Deployment documentation](/docs/deployment)\n- [The NEO•ONE CLI](/docs/cli)\n- [Network configuration](/docs/config-options)\n- [Project contribution](/docs/how-to-contribute#How-Can-I-Contribute)\n- [Compiler contribution](/docs/smart-contract-compiler)\n\nStumped on something and can’t find documentation for it? Feel free to submit a new [issue](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one/issues) to request it!\n\n## Bug Fixes / Feature Changes\n\nIn NEO•ONE 2.7 several bugs have been fixed and features have been updated.
