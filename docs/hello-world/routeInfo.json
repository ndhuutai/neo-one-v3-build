Once you master the basics through this guide, you'll be able to create complex dapps using NEO•ONE.\n\n::: warning\n\nTip\n\nThis guide is designed for people who prefer **learning concepts step by step**. If instead you'd like to learn by doing, check out [NEO•ONE Courses](/course) or the [tutorial](/tutorial). This guide can also serve as a complementary resource to the courses and tutorial.\n\n:::\n\nThis chapter provides an overview and serves as the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about the main NEO•ONE concepts. In the navigation sidebar you'll find a list of all its chapters. On a mobile device, access the guide navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.\n\nEach chapter in this guide builds on the lessons learned in earlier chapters. **You can learn most of NEO•ONE by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.** If you plan to use only one piece of NEO•ONE, then you might find it useful to skip around to the parts that are relevant to you.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Knowledge\n\nNEO•ONE is a JavaScript library so we'll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. **If you're not sure, we recommend taking a [JavaScript tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) to check your knowledge level**. It might take some time to complete, but then you won't be trying to learn both NEO•ONE and JavaScript at the same time.\n\nNEO•ONE itself is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and throughout the guide we will use TypeScript, however the guide assumes no prior knowledge. We will introduce TypeScript specific concepts as they're used, with links to documentation to learn more.\n\n---\n\n## Let's Get Started!\n\nAt the bottom of each page in the guide, including this one, you'll find the link to the [next chapter of the guide](/docs/blockchain-basics) right before the website footer.\n"},"link":"packages/neo-one-website/docs/1-main-concepts/00-hello-world.md","sidebar":[{"title":"Installation","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"Getting Started","slug":"/docs/getting-started"},{"title":"Environment Setup","slug":"/docs/environment-setup"},{"title":"CLI","slug":"/docs/cli"},{"title":"Playground","slug":"/docs/playground"}]},{"title":"Main Concepts","numbered":true,"subsections":[{"title":"Hello World","slug":"/docs/hello-world"},{"title":"Blockchain Basics","slug":"/docs/blockchain-basics"},{"title":"Smart Contract Basics","slug":"/docs/smart-contract-basics"},{"title":"Standard Library","slug":"/docs/standard-library"},{"title":"Properties and Storage","slug":"/docs/properties-and-storage"},{"title":"Methods","slug":"/docs/methods"},{"title":"Events and Logs","slug":"/docs/events-and-logs"},{"title":"Calling Smart Contracts","slug":"/docs/calling-smart-contracts"},{"title":"Client APIs","slug":"/docs/client-apis"},{"title":"Smart Contract APIs","slug":"/docs/smart-contract-apis"},{"title":"Testing","slug":"/docs/testing"},{"title":"Decentralized Apps","slug":"/docs/dapps"},{"title":"Deployment","slug":"/docs/deployment"}]},{"title":"Advanced Guides","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"Native Assets","slug":"/docs/native-assets"},{"title":"Forward Values","slug":"/docs/forward-values"},{"title":"User Accounts","slug":"/docs/user-accounts"},{"title":"Extended Client APIs","slug":"/docs/extended-client-apis"},{"title":"Raw Client APIs","slug":"/docs/Raw-client-apis"},{"title":"React","slug":"/docs/react"},{"title":"Angular","slug":"/docs/angular"},{"title":"Vue","slug":"/docs/vue"},{"title":"dAPI Support","slug":"/docs/dapi-support"},{"title":"Configuration Options","slug":"/docs/config-options"}]},{"title":"Node","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"Local Docker Development","slug":"/docs/node-docker"},{"title":"Kubernetes","slug":"/docs/node-kubernetes"},{"title":"Docker Compose","slug":"/docs/node-compose"},{"title":"Building From Source","slug":"/docs/node-source"},{"title":"Heroku Deployment","slug":"/docs/node-heroku"},{"title":"Configuration Reference","slug":"/docs/node-configuration"}]},{"title":"Contributing","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"How to Contribute","slug":"/docs/how-to-contribute"},{"title":"Codebase Overview","slug":"/docs/codebase-overview"},{"title":"Smart Contract Compiler","slug":"/docs/smart-contract-compiler"},{"title":"Code of Conduct","slug":"/docs/code-of-conduct"}]}],"next":{"slug":"/docs/blockchain-basics","title":"Blockchain Basics"},"previous":{"slug":"/docs/playground","title":"Playground"}},"path":"docs/hello-world"}
