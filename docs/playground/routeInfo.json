Add `--watch` to listen for changes to the smart contracts and trigger automatic recompilation and deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Start the Playground\n\n```bash\n# npm start\nyarn start\n```\n\nThis will open a browser window with the playground. Modify the files in the `src` directory to get a feel for using the NEO•ONE client APIs.\n\n---\n\n## Run the tests\n\n```bash\n# npm test\nyarn test\n```\n\nSmart contract tests in the playground are written in Jest and are located in the `src/__tests__` directory. Play around with them to see how easy it is to test smart contracts!\n"},"link":"packages/neo-one-website/docs/0-installation/3-playground.md","sidebar":[{"title":"Installation","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"Getting Started","slug":"/docs/getting-started"},{"title":"Environment Setup","slug":"/docs/environment-setup"},{"title":"CLI","slug":"/docs/cli"},{"title":"Playground","slug":"/docs/playground"}]},{"title":"Main Concepts","numbered":true,"subsections":[{"title":"Hello World","slug":"/docs/hello-world"},{"title":"Blockchain Basics","slug":"/docs/blockchain-basics"},{"title":"Smart Contract Basics","slug":"/docs/smart-contract-basics"},{"title":"Standard Library","slug":"/docs/standard-library"},{"title":"Properties and Storage","slug":"/docs/properties-and-storage"},{"title":"Methods","slug":"/docs/methods"},{"title":"Events and Logs","slug":"/docs/events-and-logs"},{"title":"Calling Smart Contracts","slug":"/docs/calling-smart-contracts"},{"title":"Client APIs","slug":"/docs/client-apis"},{"title":"Smart Contract APIs","slug":"/docs/smart-contract-apis"},{"title":"Testing","slug":"/docs/testing"},{"title":"Decentralized Apps","slug":"/docs/dapps"},{"title":"Deployment","slug":"/docs/deployment"}]},{"title":"Advanced Guides","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"Native Assets","slug":"/docs/native-assets"},{"title":"Forward Values","slug":"/docs/forward-values"},{"title":"User Accounts","slug":"/docs/user-accounts"},{"title":"Extended Client APIs","slug":"/docs/extended-client-apis"},{"title":"Raw Client APIs","slug":"/docs/Raw-client-apis"},{"title":"React","slug":"/docs/react"},{"title":"Angular","slug":"/docs/angular"},{"title":"Vue","slug":"/docs/vue"},{"title":"dAPI Support","slug":"/docs/dapi-support"},{"title":"Configuration Options","slug":"/docs/config-options"}]},{"title":"Node","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"Local Docker Development","slug":"/docs/node-docker"},{"title":"Kubernetes","slug":"/docs/node-kubernetes"},{"title":"Docker Compose","slug":"/docs/node-compose"},{"title":"Building From Source","slug":"/docs/node-source"},{"title":"Heroku Deployment","slug":"/docs/node-heroku"},{"title":"Configuration Reference","slug":"/docs/node-configuration"}]},{"title":"Contributing","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"How to Contribute","slug":"/docs/how-to-contribute"},{"title":"Codebase Overview","slug":"/docs/codebase-overview"},{"title":"Smart Contract Compiler","slug":"/docs/smart-contract-compiler"},{"title":"Code of Conduct","slug":"/docs/code-of-conduct"}]}],"next":{"slug":"/docs/hello-world","title":"Hello World"},"previous":{"slug":"/docs/cli","title":"CLI"}},"path":"docs/playground"}
