NEO•ONE is organized into multiple individual packages. Use as much or as little as you like. Each package may be installed using either [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (`yarn add <package name>`) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (`npm install <package name>`). Each package has the form `@neo-one/<name>`, for example, `@neo-one/client`.\n\nMake sure to install the correct versions of these packages. If you are working on Neo2 then make sure you are installing NEO•ONE packages at version 2.x.x or lower. Version 3.0.0 or higher will be for Neo3.\n\nInstall all the neo-one packages with yarn by running:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @neo-one/client @neo-one/cli @neo-one/smart-contract @neo-one/smart-contract-test @neo-one/smart-contract-lib @neo-one/smart-contract-typescript-plugin\n```\n\nInstall everything individually with npm by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @neo-one/client @neo-one/cli @neo-one/smart-contract @neo-one/smart-contract-test @neo-one/smart-contract-lib @neo-one/smart-contract-typescript-plugin\n```\n\nand then follow the [main guide](/docs/hello-world) or the [tutorial](/tutorial). By the end of it you'll know which features of NEO•ONE you're using and which packages to keep.\n\nKnow what you want to use from NEO•ONE? Read on to see which packages to install for specific functionality.\n\nFor interacting with smart contracts, you should install\n\n- `@neo-one/client` - Main entrypoint to the most common NEO•ONE client APIs.\n\nFor local network and smart contract management, you should install\n\n- `@neo-one/cli` - Provides the `neo-one` cli command which manages common tasks like building and deploying smart contracts and spinning up local networks.\n\nIn addition to the above, if you're developing TypeScript smart contracts using NEO•ONE, you should install\n\n- `@neo-one/smart-contract` - TypeScript smart contract standard library.\n- `@neo-one/smart-contract-test` - TypeScript smart contract testing utilitiees.\n- `@neo-one/smart-contract-lib` - Template library for common smart contract patterns.\n- `@neo-one/smart-contract-typescript-plugin` - TypeScript language server plugin for inline compiler diagnostics in your favorite IDE.\n\n### Update\n\n```bash\n#npm update @neo-one/cli\nyarn upgrade @neo-one/cli\n```\n\n### Editor Setup\n\nConfigure your IDE to use your local TypeScript installation and the `@neo-one/smart-contract-typescript-plugin` in order to take advantage of inline compiler diagnostics. These instructions are for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but they should be similar for any editor that supports TypeScript IntelliSense.\n\n1. Ensure `@neo-one/cli` and `@neo-one/smart-contract-typescript-plugin` are installed.\n2. Run `yarn neo-one init` or `npx neo-one init`. This will create a `tsconfig.json` file in the configured smart contract directory (by default, `neo-one/contracts/tsconfig.json`).\n3. Open a TypeScript file, then click the TypeScript version number in the lower right hand side of your editor and choose \"Use Workspace Version\"\n\nThat's it! Enjoy inline smart contract compiler diagnostics.\n\n## Javascript Environment Requirements\n\nNEO•ONE depends on several types which older browser may not support. NEO•ONE requires the collection types [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) and [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) as well as [Symbol.asyncIterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator). If you support older browsers and devices which may not yet provide these natively, consider including a global polyfill in your bundled application, such as [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [babel-polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill/).\n\nTo polyfill an environment for NEO•ONE using core-js, include the following lines at the top of your entry point.\n\n```typescript\nimport 'core-js/es/map';\nimport 'core-js/es/set';\nimport 'core-js/es/symbol/async-iterator';\n```\n"},"link":"packages/neo-one-website/docs/0-installation/1-environment-setup.md","sidebar":[{"title":"Installation","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"Getting Started","slug":"/docs/getting-started"},{"title":"Environment Setup","slug":"/docs/environment-setup"},{"title":"CLI","slug":"/docs/cli"},{"title":"Playground","slug":"/docs/playground"}]},{"title":"Main Concepts","numbered":true,"subsections":[{"title":"Hello World","slug":"/docs/hello-world"},{"title":"Blockchain Basics","slug":"/docs/blockchain-basics"},{"title":"Smart Contract Basics","slug":"/docs/smart-contract-basics"},{"title":"Standard Library","slug":"/docs/standard-library"},{"title":"Properties and Storage","slug":"/docs/properties-and-storage"},{"title":"Methods","slug":"/docs/methods"},{"title":"Events and Logs","slug":"/docs/events-and-logs"},{"title":"Calling Smart Contracts","slug":"/docs/calling-smart-contracts"},{"title":"Client APIs","slug":"/docs/client-apis"},{"title":"Smart Contract APIs","slug":"/docs/smart-contract-apis"},{"title":"Testing","slug":"/docs/testing"},{"title":"Decentralized Apps","slug":"/docs/dapps"},{"title":"Deployment","slug":"/docs/deployment"}]},{"title":"Advanced Guides","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"Native Assets","slug":"/docs/native-assets"},{"title":"Forward Values","slug":"/docs/forward-values"},{"title":"User Accounts","slug":"/docs/user-accounts"},{"title":"Extended Client APIs","slug":"/docs/extended-client-apis"},{"title":"Raw Client APIs","slug":"/docs/Raw-client-apis"},{"title":"React","slug":"/docs/react"},{"title":"Angular","slug":"/docs/angular"},{"title":"Vue","slug":"/docs/vue"},{"title":"dAPI Support","slug":"/docs/dapi-support"},{"title":"Configuration Options","slug":"/docs/config-options"}]},{"title":"Node","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"Local Docker Development","slug":"/docs/node-docker"},{"title":"Kubernetes","slug":"/docs/node-kubernetes"},{"title":"Docker Compose","slug":"/docs/node-compose"},{"title":"Building From Source","slug":"/docs/node-source"},{"title":"Heroku Deployment","slug":"/docs/node-heroku"},{"title":"Configuration Reference","slug":"/docs/node-configuration"}]},{"title":"Contributing","numbered":false,"subsections":[{"title":"How to Contribute","slug":"/docs/how-to-contribute"},{"title":"Codebase Overview","slug":"/docs/codebase-overview"},{"title":"Smart Contract Compiler","slug":"/docs/smart-contract-compiler"},{"title":"Code of Conduct","slug":"/docs/code-of-conduct"}]}],"next":{"slug":"/docs/cli","title":"CLI"},"previous":{"slug":"/docs/getting-started","title":"Getting Started"}},"path":"docs/environment-setup"}
